        <h1>THE HAND</h1>
        <p>THE HAND BY MARCELLA DEVILLE, 7 chakras into divination & chill this gucci palm asks you to read its love line, what do you do? We all have an aura - whether we can see it or feel it or not. The aura is made of a more "subtle" substance than is the physical body, but this does not makeit any the less real, or infact any the less physical - it is simply physical in a different way. The aura is affected by all kinds of things: the way we think, who we talk to, our environment and so on. </p>
